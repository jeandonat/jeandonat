# Jean-Donat Vellino (JD) — SOC Lab Builder (Wazuh) + Local AI (Ollama/RAG)

I build reproducible security labs with proof screenshots, write-ups, and triage workflows.

## ⭐ Featured proof
**Falco runtime detection → Wazuh alert (MITRE T1059)**  
Interactive shell in a container → Falco → Wazuh agent → correlation rule → dashboard evidence.  
➡️ Repo: ai-cybersecurity-roadmap → Project 8  
(Embed 1 screenshot here.)

## Pinned projects
- **AI-Driven Cybersecurity Roadmap (Mini-SOC)** — Wazuh SIEM, detections, dashboards, reports.
- **Local AI Cybersecurity RAG Lab** — Ollama + OpenWebUI + offline-first knowledge base.

## What I’m building next
- **Project 9: SOC integration & reporting** (case notes, KPIs, architecture diagram, exec summary)
